<h2> Latest Blast </h2>
<i>Everyone has secrets, locked away in the corner of their minds, hoping nobody will ever discover them, but what 
happens when someone finds the key? What happens when the key is put in the keyhole and the door to all your secrets 
is slowly opened for everyone to see. Since none of you won the scavenger hunt, I guess I have to reveal all of your 
secrets. They say two can keep a secret if one of them is dead, but lovies I'm not going anywhere. Here are the 
dirtiest secrets of the Upper East Side.
</i>
<ul>
<li> Our It girl Paris Hilton, has been arrested this evening after partying hard on the club. And to prove it here's 
a picture of her mugshot. I don't think I would ever say this but orange might really be her color. </li>

<li> Model Kate Moss was recently found snorting cocaine on the bacstage of a prestigious fashion show, this might
lead to her losing numerous contracts. But oh well ig guess you do you, ain't I right K!!? </li>

<li> Looks like our pop princess (Britney Spears) might be going through a hard time, that may be one of the reasons
she wlaked right into a public bathroom completly barefoot (gross). You might have seen her new look with a shaved head, 
that was one of our biggest blast's. We hope you come to your senses soon love, kisses. </li>

<li> Girl girl girl!! Rumors say Khlo√© Kardashian might spend some little time in prison (30 days to be exact) after 
she violated the terms of her probation </li>

<li> In a move straight out a tv show Chase Crawford as been arrested for possession of marijuana. Maybe that's why we
haven't see much of him lately. But even i have to admit that Chase migh have one of the best mugshots in my collection.
</li>

<i>So here are all you're dirty little secrets that you that nobody would ever find out. I think I might have started a 
war on the Upper East Side? Looks like it's not going to be such a Happy New Year for everyone, but as far as I'm concerned,
I'm having the happiest New Year of them all.
